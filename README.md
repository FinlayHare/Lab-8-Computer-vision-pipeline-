This MATLAB script demonstrates a hybrid approach to image processing, combining traditional computer vision techniques with AI-powered deep learning for object isolation and classification.

Traditional Preprocessing	K-Means clustering used for color-based segmentation, effectively isolating the main object from the background.

AI Classification	SqueezeNet pre-trained neural network employed for image classification, demonstrating deep learning capabilities.

Hybrid Approach	Combines traditional image processing with AI techniques to improve overall classification accuracy.
